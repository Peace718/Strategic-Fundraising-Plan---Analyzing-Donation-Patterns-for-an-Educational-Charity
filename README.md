# Strategic Fundraising Plan - Analyzing Donation Patterns for an Educational Charity



## Introduction

Charity is about building a better world, and there's no better way to do that than by equipping the younger generation with essential skills and resources. Educational charities play a vital role in ensuring a brighter future for children, even amidst global challenges. The Education For All Foundation is one such organization, offering free English education to underprivileged children worldwide. By connecting bilingual volunteers from North America and beyond with children in rural developing nations, the Foundation provides not only language skills but also emotional support, mentorship, and financial aid. Through its multi-cultural community of dedicated volunteers, the Foundation aims to empower these children, giving them the confidence to shape their own futures.
